# Modular_app_Js
My first mudular node js app that runs a comand line. the app should be able to produce shapes of different sizes according to what the user inputs.

**Britz_Estiaan_578355**

The Shapes.js file should be run using: 
node Shapes.js

The app displays a menu with 4 options that allow you to pick a shape or exit
1. Triange
2. Square
3. Diamond
4. Exit

    When selecting a shape it will ask you to select a size

        This will then display a shape corresponding to the number you selected
            
        After the shape is displayed it will ask if you want to continue or not

            If you select yes it will take you back to the initial menu.

            If you select no the app will exit.

            If you select a value that does not correspond to the options it will take you back to the initial menu with a warning

    When selecting Exit it will ask you if you are sure you want to exit

        if you select yes it will exit

        if you select no it will take you to the initial menu 

        If you select a value that does not correspond to the options it will take you back to the initial menu with a warning

    When celecting a number that is not displayed it will take you back to the initial menu with a warning
